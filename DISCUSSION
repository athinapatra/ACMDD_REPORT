During the similarity investigation, we searched three different databases which comprise large repositories of millions of freely accessible compounds. Particularly, in ChEMBL no similar compounds were obtained when setting the similarity index to 80%, whereas in the PubChem database we obtained 6 compounds with 90% similarity and 125 compounds when the similarity index was set to 80%. This can be explained by the fact that in PubChem 329 million compounds are registered whereas in ChEMBL only 2.5 million compounds can be found. Finally, the Zinc database contains over 230 million purchasable compounds, in ready-to-dock 3D formats,(3) in which 4 compounds were obtained with a similarity of 70% to our ligand. For the Machine Learning part of the study, we downloaded compounds from ChEMBL.
In the Machine Learning as well as in the docking exercises we tried to run different molecules based on the two chemical structures of the compounds that have reached the clinical phase I and I, targeting JNK1. Taking into account our reference co-crystallized ligand we got a deeper insight into its main interactions with our protein of interest, JNK1, using the Protein Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP). In this way, we could generate derivatives that entail similar interactions with amino acids existing in close proximity to the binding site.

Looking into the first illustration of the ligand inside the binding pocket we observe that the main interactions are obtained through two hydrogen bonds; one between the NH2 group of the ligand and the oxygen of a glutamine close to the binding site and another one between the carbonyl group of the ligand and the amine of methionine existing in close proximity to the binding site. In addition, hydrophobic interactions are observed between the aromatic ring and the amino acid of isoleucine as well as between the ligand and methionine.

In the second illustration, we can observe additional interactions between the ligand and JNK1. More specifically, we observe one additional hydrogen bond between the nitrogen of the cyano moiety and a lysine as well as one between the oxygen which is in meta position to the bromine and asparagine. Moreover, four more hydrophobic interactions are observed. These interactions are mainly the results of interactions between the aromatic rings and adjacent amino acids. Lastly, the halogen bond between the bromine and a lysine seems to stabilize even more the ligand inside the binding pocket.

Taking into account these interactions as well as the structures of the two most promising compounds that underwent phase II of clinical trials we move on to the generation of new molecules. First, having noticed a variety of hydrogen bonds forming between nitrogen atoms and proximal amino acids, we substituted the fluorine atoms with an amino group. However, we observed a slightly  lower pIC50 of 7.05 compared to the parent compound which presented a pIC50 of 7.17, indicating that the fluorine atoms are actually essential for more efficient binding to our protein of interest. The reason behind that could be that the electron-withdrawing properties of the fluorine atoms make the nitrogen more electrophilic, thus forming stronger hydrogen bonds with the close-by amino acids. In addition, the halogen bonds of the fluorine atoms might significantly stabilize the ligand inside the binding pocket.

Following we can see some docking poses of the generated molecule which presented a docking score of -8.100 kcal/mol compared to the parent compound for which we obtained a docking score of -7.840 kcal/mol.

Next, we explored the influence of an additional amino group in the meta position on the existing amino group. A further decrease of the pIC50 (6.91) indicated that no significant interactions were obtained with this modification. In contrast, this modification might cause steric hindrance, not allowing in this way, the formation of possible hydrogen bonds of the adjacent amine with the respective amino acids.

The docking score obtained for this molecule was -8.002 kcal/mol. Generally, we noticed a contradictory relationship between the docking scores and the pIC50 values, indicating that we should further investigate and take into account the reasons behind this. 

For our second parent compound, we generated one more molecule. Following a similar strategy, we substituted the piperidine ethyl ether group with an amino group. The pIC50 of 6.07 was slightly lower than the one of the parent compound which presented a pIC50 of 6.09. Therefore, a hydrogen bond from the etherâ€™s oxygen in combination with hydrophobic interactions generated by the ethyl chain might stabilize this configuration compared to the generated molecule. However, the ability of the nitrogen to form stable hydrogen bonds might be the reason why the pIC50 is still comparable to the one of the parent compound.

Following we can see some docking poses of the generated molecule which presented a docking score of -8.537 kcal/mol compared to the parent compound which presented a docking score of -8.786 kcal/mol.
